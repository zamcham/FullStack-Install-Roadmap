Here are the steps to install Jest and the Jest local storage mock:

---

1. **Initialize the project**: You can skip this if you already have a package.json file, else, you need a new npm project by running
```JavaScript
npm init
```

2. **Start installation**: Install Jest and Babel dependencies by running:
```
npm install --save-dev jest @babel/core @babel/preset-env babel-jest
```

3. **Add Babel Configuration**: Create a new file named '.babelrc' in the root directory of your project and add the following configuration to it
```
{
  "presets": [
    ["@babel/preset-env", {
      "targets": {
        "node": "current"
      }
    }]
  ]
}
```

4. **Update the scripts on your JSON**: Add the following scripts to your package.json file:
```
"scripts": {
  "test": "jest"
}
```

ðŸŽ‰ That's it! You should now have Jest and Babel properly installed and configured to run tests for your functions.
